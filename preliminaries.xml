    <title>Using Sage Math</title>


    <introduction>

        <p> Sage is a powerful OpenSource system with the goal of being a viable alternative to Magma, Mathematica, Maple, and Matlab.
            In this initial chapter we will consider how to get up and running with SageMath.</p>

        <p>
            There are several approaches to using Sage Math:

                <p>Using SageMath online.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Downloading the source and running locally.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>using SageMath Cells embedded in your own web documents</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Installing Android or iOS Apps on your phone or tablet.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>We will now look at some of these methods.</p>

            <p>
                Probably the easiest way to familiarise yourself with SageMath is to use a Sage Math Cloud Server.
                From the main <url href="http://www.sagemath.org">SageMath</url> page select the
                <url href="https://cloud.sagemath.com/projects">Sage Online</url> link. You will
                have to set up an account but these are free for basic usage.
            </p>

            <p> Once you have set up an account you can then create a project and a SageMath Worksheet.
                There are full instructions here <url href="http://doc.sagemath.org/html/en/prep/Logging-On.html">Logging On</url>.</p>

            <p>Screenshots of sample session - TBD</p>
