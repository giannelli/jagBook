# MathBook XML Sample Book

**2016-0-27**: this is a work in-progress.

This sample book began as a subset of the sample-book provided by MathBook XML.  I am using this as a framework to start a notebook
that can be used to keep notes on Sage Math and anything else I may be teaching myself.

To build:

xsltproc --xinclude /path/to/mathbook/xsl/mathbook-html.xsl jag-book.xml
